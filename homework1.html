<p> Michelle Fong, a strong IT Professional with over 10 years of project management and business analysis experiences in eCommerce and technical environment with focus on maximizing customer satisfaction and cost reduction. I have extensive business process re-engineering experience in providing actionable and strategic recommendations, based on quantitative and qualitative data, resulting in streamlined processes and increased productivity. In addition, with the exceptional skills in customer support and effective partnership building within a matrix environment, I’m aspired to apply advanced education and highly experienced work skills effectively.   
<br><br> Throughout my IT industry career, I’ve been working closely with multiple technical teams including web developer and QA to deliver enhanced digital self-service functionalities to our customer. I have been involved all parts of the development life cycle, including architecture, development, testing, training, implementation and supporting of IT systems. In addition, I have been partnering with business team and technical team to identify project and process deficiencies and opportunities to resolve and improve. As I continue to work with developer and QA closing on a daily basis, I find it will be very beneficial for me to understanding the technical coding parts further such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, so it helps me to enhance my technical problem-solving skills. Furthermore, I love learning and expanding my knowledge as a designer and front-end developer. I believe learning through practices are extremely helpful such as reading articles, watching tutorial videos, participating into online courses, and completing real life practices and projects. One of my recommended favorite sites is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W3 Schools.com</a>, offers plenty of information and clarifications on any HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any type of web programming language. 
    
<br><br> As I learn and expand my knowledge in web development, I continue to keep up with all the latest design trends, technology, news by reading various websites. One benefits I found to be a CCSF student is I can always leverage the Counseling Service at CCSF for career support, advices, and counseling. The counselors in various departments are all here to help students to find ways through City College and in completing their educational goals. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#leftnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counseling Service at CCSF</a> page.

<h3>Good Links</h3>

Below I have listed 3 of my favorite websites for a Web Developer to follow:   
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> - GitHub is a community-driven development platform where you can learn new techniques from over 23 million developers, as well as share your own knowledge and resource.
        GitHub is not only a great place to find and host code for your website or application dev projects, but it’s also a place where you can work with others, or help others, including teams, on all kinds of web projects, from software development to apps and websites.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - Stack Overflow is  very popular community-driven development platform. Over 50 million devs use Stack Overflow, it really is the ultimate ‘go-to’ place online for any budding developer looking to learn new coding tricks, expand their knowledge and even share their wisdom too.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://www.webdesignernews.com/">Web Designers News</a> - Web developers, as well as designers, should always stay up to date with all the latest news, events, trends, etc. One of the best ways in which to do all those things is to visit Web Designer News.
